### How it works?

- Put the executable file in a different folder than the folder you want to rename the files.
- Run this file: rename_images.vbs
- Paste the full path of the folder C:\Users\Example\Documents\Images
- Then choose a new prefix for the files. The files will look like this: example_01 example_02 example_03
- At the end of the execution, the number of renamed and unrenamed files will be displayed.
